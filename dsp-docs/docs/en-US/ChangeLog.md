## v2.3.0

`2021-06-18`

+ ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Sorting supports a more friendly and simpler [sort form](/features/markdown-file-config.html#autosort) now.

  I don't understand why I ignored such a common requirement before.



## v2.2.3

`2021-05-15`

+ ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Directories now support [more forms](https://github.com/shanyuhai123/vuepress-plugin-auto-sidebar/tree/master/packages/vuepress-docs-gh-pages/docs), even with emoji.

  However, when this rule is matched, [mode](/features/plugin-options.html#_1-built-in-mode) will be disabled in that directory and will not affect the rest of the directories.
